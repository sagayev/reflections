What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a git with "git init" commands, it doesn't commit for
	you. If you use "git log" it will say fatal:your current branch 'master' does not have any commits yet.
	"git status" will show untracked files. I think we sould use "git add" to track them.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area gives more flexibility. You can add there and reset from there.
	Then you can commit once you are done with your staging area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	We can use staging area to organize commits per logical changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	Braches (which we create by "git branch lablablab") is useful if we want to
	try something crazy but want keep our history tidy...

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Diagrams (which we can get the idea with git git log --graph --oneline master a_branch_name)
	can help visualize log history inter branches...

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
	Commits from different branches are merged according to their dates. Then on
	master (if we checkedout there) we see all commits from different branches.
	Graph shows visualization when a change was made. For example, when a coin was
	introduced...

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
	Automatic merge whenever possible should be chosen. If not we can review andadjust
	what should be stayed on the conflicted file.
