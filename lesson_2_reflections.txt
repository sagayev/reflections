What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a git with "git init" commands, it doesn't commit for
	you. If you use "git log" it will say fatal:your current branch 'master' does not have any commits yet.
	"git status" will show untracked files. I think we sould use "git add" to track them.
