  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Obviously, when I want to share it with other people. Also if I want to work on my data
from different environments, like from home or workplace...

  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Actually, I am not sure, but I think there might be privacy concern.
